# iheart
### iHeart Radio JavaScript API

Query the iHeart Radio API to search for internet radio stations.
Get their metadata including name and logos, and resolve high-quality
stream URLs to play.


## Installation

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install --save iheart
```


## Example

```js
// search for a station, pick the first match
const matches = await iheart.search(process.argv[2] || '1077 the bone')
const station = matches.stations[0]

// finally you can get the source stream URL which can
// be requested over HTTP and fed into an audio decoder,
// or whatever your application does with itâ€¦
const url = await iheart.streamURL(station)

console.log(url)
// https://18533.live.streamtheworld.com:443/KSANFMAAC_SC
```

Both `search` and `streamURL` have an option to specify CORS proxy
so that these APIs work in the web browser

```js
// use specific proxy
const matches2 = await iheart.search('MyFM', { proxy: 'https://mycoolproxy.com' })
// use default proxy
const matches3 = await iheart.search('Jazz')
// do not use proxy (good for server side code)
const url2 = await iheart.streamURL(station, { proxy: null })
```
